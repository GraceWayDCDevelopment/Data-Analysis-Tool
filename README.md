# Data-Analysis-Tool
Create a open source analysis tool that will integrate various data and file types. 

## Synopsis
This project is part of the Open Digerati Community (https://opendigerati.com/projects/) to develop ideas on around the creation of an open source data analysis tool that organizations can use against existing datasets or their own generated datasets. As this tool is being designed for the non-profit and church communities in mind, the tools need to be easy use by individuals with a layman's understanding of data analysis. The project is being sponsored by Compassion International. 

The first step is develop a tool that can consume data from APIs and import various data file types (.csv, kml, xml, etc) and convert data from all sources to a commen structure and format. Once we have the data integration and storage components built we want to look at developing the analysis tool. 

## Getting Involved

## Project Use Case
The scenario we want to use for this project is to combine population data, administrative district data, and church location data of Uganda into a single data store. We will be importing population figures, and area in kilometers for each district in Uganda along with the district boundaries. We will create a population density by district for individuals under the age of 18 by calculating and storing the number of people per square kilometer. By combining this information with the church locations, we can identify potential church partnerships for Compassionâ€™s program based on youth population density.

The data files and links to API data sources can be found in the Test-Scenario folder.
